# TournamentTracker
First C# GUI

This application is my first gui application using C# and my first gui application in general. 
The application's purpose is basically in its name. It is an application that can create and track tournaments. 
The tournaments that are created and tracked can be pretty much any type of tournament. 
Basketball, ping pong, tennis, bowling, etc...

This application is still not complete yet. The forms have been completed, however, the backend sql is not finished yet.
